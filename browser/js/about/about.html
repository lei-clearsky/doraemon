    <h3 align="center">Private Pixels - A Visual UI Test Automation Service</h3>
    <br>
    <br>

    <span>An automatic visual UI testing and monitoring service built on the MEAN stack.</span>
    <br>

    <span>Our stack basically consists of:</span>
    <ul>
    	<li>Nightmare.js which is a headless browser using the Webkit render engine. Used to create snapshots of webpages.</li>
    	<li>GraphicsMagick is an image manipulation tool able to run in node.js. Used to create a diff image of two snapshots.</li>
    	<li>AWS is used to store our images.</li>
    	<li>CronJob is used to schedule tasks at set intervals.</li>
    	<li>Roboto is a web crawler used to find web pages on a site.</li> 
    	<li>Angular, Bootstrap & Sass is used in the front end to create our dynamic UI.</li>
    	<li>FSG was used as a basic MEAN stack scaffolding generator.</li>
    </ul>

	<span>
    	At set intervals, we use nightmare.js to take a snapshot of a webpage at a given URL. With this current snapshot, we will then grab the previous snapshot taken at that webpage, then use GraphicsMagick to create a diff image of the two snapshots. That diff image is then posted in our dashboard and an alert is set if a substantial difference is calculated. Check out our repo <a href="https://github.com/lei-clearsky/doraemon">here</a>

    <span>A Chrome Extension was also developed to test single page applications and web pages with dynamic UI features. Check out the Chrome Extension repo <a href="https://github.com/vatteh/doraemon_recorder">here</a></span>
