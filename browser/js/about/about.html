        <h1 class="text-center">Private Pixels - A Visual UI Test Automation Service</h1>
        <p>An automatic visual UI testing and monitoring service built on the MEAN stack.</p>

        <p>Our stack basically consists of:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Nightmare.js which is a headless browser using the Webkit render engine. Used to create snapshots of webpages.</li>
        	<li>GraphicsMagick is an image manipulation tool able to run in node.js. Used to create a diff image of two snapshots.</li>
        	<li>AWS is used to store our images.</li>
        	<li>CronJob is used to schedule tasks at set intervals.</li>
        	<li>Roboto is a web crawler used to find web pages on a site.</li> 
        	<li>Angular, Bootstrap & Sass is used in the front end to create our dynamic UI.</li>
        	<li>FSG was used as a basic MEAN stack scaffolding generator.</li>
        </ul>

    	<p>
        	At set intervals, we use nightmare.js to take a snapshot of a webpage at a given URL. With this current snapshot, we will then grab the previous snapshot taken at that URL, then use GraphicsMagick to create a diff image of the two snapshots. That diff image is then posted in our dashboard and an alert is set if a substantial difference is calculated. <strong>Check out our repo <a href="https://github.com/lei-clearsky/doraemon">here</a></strong>

        <p>A <strong>Chrome Extension</strong> was also developed to test single page applications and web pages with dynamic UI features. <strong>Download it at the play store <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/private-pixels-step-recor/mjmcnfmjfnhdpngopmpdlegjpidnnmip">here</a> and check out the Chrome Extension repo <a href="https://github.com/vatteh/doraemon_recorder">here</a></strong></p>
